# Overview

This is a simple portfolio site hosted on github pages. It uses the jkeyll static site generator. It contains my Resume, a list of projects I've worked on, and a blog. The blog is mainly centered around education technology and how to best utlize vr tech in the classroom, but may cover any topic that I would like to keep tabs on or explains my philisophy when deigning technology. I'm hoping that spending time researching and writing about these topics will help me to better understand them and be able to apply them in my future career. 

{Talk about research aspect and the sources for the blog here maybe, consider putting it in the dev environment section}
